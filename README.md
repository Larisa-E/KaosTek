## Customer database
Clear relationships between tables (customers, orders, order details, users). The use of primary and foreign keys ensures data integrity. For better functionality I used basic CRUD and security with hashed passwords.

The use of modern technologies like Bootstrap and PHP with MySQL provides a robust framework for further development. The basic functions are user authentication and order details management.
